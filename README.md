# LoanPaymentCalculator
This is a complex loan payment plan calculator written in c#

This is a loan payment calculator that works with different loan amounts, terms, grace periods and maturity periods for both loan and interest. This calculation also includes KKDF and BSMV which are certain percent of taxes in Turkey cut from the interest rate you pay. So feel free to delete them as you wish. When I needed this code I couldn't find any open resources in the internet that had it. I only found calculators as closed source. The code is in Turkish because I wrote this for my work. But I hope this helps you if you are in need.
